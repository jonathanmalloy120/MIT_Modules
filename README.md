This is my repo for all files related to the weekly modules for the MIT bootcamp. 

Files will be random collections of whatever we are working on, primarily HTML, CSS and Javascript-based. 

The general purpose of this repo will be for exercises related to learing full stack MERN development. 

Feel free to browse and use anything you think is useful. Enjoy!

Jon
